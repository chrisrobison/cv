I have experience managing small and large teams at NetOasis, Genetic Savings & Clone, Interactivate and Mediaplex.\n\nI understand the business ramifications of operational issues in addition to understanding the systems and technology they support.  My exposure to all aspects of business from the customer to the backend to the frontend has enabled me to build systems and software that look at the big picture and increase the bottom line.\n\nI have been pushing the limits of Javascript, CSS, HTML since their inception and, more recently, leveraged the power of web 2.0 technologies (AJAX \/ XMLHttpRequest \/ JSON) to architect and develop web applications.  My server-side skill set is as strong, if not stronger, than my front-end.  I have extensive experience with object oriented programming and have implemented just about every design pattern known to man.  Expert with most modern programming languages such as Javascript, Java, PHP, C#, Swift,  Python and others.  I'm also a pretty good Unix (Linux\/FreeBSD\/Solaris) systems administrator.\n\nSpecialties: Javascript (nodejs & client), NoSQL (MongoDB, redis), business process management & automation, web based software, programming, software frameworks, XML, DOM, PHP, Perl, Javascript, AJAX",
