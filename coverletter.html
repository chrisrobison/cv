            </p>

            <p>Dear {{recipient}},</p>
            <p>It was with great interest that I read your
            posting on {{origin}} for the position of {{position}} at {{company}}. I
                respectfully proffer my candidacy for this position and have attached my resum√©
                for your perusal. I am confident you will agree that I have the necessary qualifications to
                execute the tasks associated with the job. </p>
            <p>I have over 20 years experience in IT with 8 of those years in management roles.
                Having started work in the industry while still in high school, I'm experienced
                enough to know what to do yet young enough to have the energy to get the job done. </p>
            <p>I have worked at corporate jobs as well as startups and while I excel in either environment,
                I really thrive in smaller environments where you are flying by the seat of your pants.
                I have a very broad set of technical skills with a focus on systems archicture, API's and software
                engineering. I can get things done quickly, yet still keep everything stable and secure. 
                I take great pride in my work and my ability to see the big picture and align
                technical solutions with business goals. I like to get hands-on with projects but know how and
                when to delegate tasks and responsibilities.</p>
            <p>I will strive to put your company at the forefront of the technology community where it
                will benefit from the attention it deserves. I have the training to be able to handle
                both the technical as well as the business side of a given issue. Further, I am a
                leader who will build a solid team dedicated to the development and implementation of
                technical solutions.</p>
            <p>I believe that to be a successful CTO of any company, you need to have experience,
                knowledge and technical ability; as well as an ability to supervise, mentor
                and coordinate talent into one direct objective. In short, I believe my years of experience,
                IT acumen and leadership skills could be of great service to your organization. I would enjoy
                the opportunity to be a part of the team that takes your company to the next level. </p>
            <p>If you would like to discuss my experience in greater depth I am available via phone, video chat or, 
                if COVID allows, in-person.  I can be reached by phone or SMS at (415) 810-6991 or by email at

            <p>Sincerely, </p>
