Period:June, 1996 - March, 1998
Company:Slip.Net
Title:Web Engineer
Desc:<div class="SMALL DESC"> Slip.Net was one of the earliest Internet Service Providers in the San Francisco Bay Area with a client base well over 30,000 users.  My roles and responsibilities were divided between system administration and web development. As the <i>Web Administrator</i> I was responsible for shared administration of server farm of 30+ machines including Sun servers and Intel PCs, all using Solaris.  I was also responsible for all web-based software, E-commerce, network accessible databases, secure server certificates, web server maintenance, and more. In addition to these administration duties, I was also given a myriad of development projects, including the renovation of the existing system of disassociated and unwieldy collection of flat text db files and dbm's that constituted their 'client database'. I developed an easy to use and coherent system of procedures, tools, scripts, and interfaces built on top of a relational SQL database. The scope of this project is beyond this resume, however, if you'd like to see a small sampling of the web applications I developed, just feed the following URL's into your browser (Username: demo, Password:demo):<br> <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan="3"><div style='position:relative;width:40px'></div></td> <td align="right"> <span class="SMALL"><b>Slip.Net Account Control Center:</b></span> </td> <!-- <td> <span class="SUBTOP"> <a href="http://www.slip.net/control/main.html">http://www.slip.net/control/main.html</a> --> <td> <span class="SUBTOP"> <span class='offline' title='OFFLINE'>OFFLINE</span> </span> </span> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right"> <span class="SUBTOP"><b>Slip.Net Signup Wizard:</b></span> </td> <td> <span class="SUBTOP"> <span class='offline' title='OFFLINE'>OFFLINE</span> </span> <!--<td> <span class="SUBTOP"> <a href="http://www.slip.net/nosetup/">http://www.slip.net/nosetup/</a> </span>--> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right"> <span class="SUBTOP"><b>Find POP Modem Dialup Number:</b></span> </td> <td> <span class="SUBTOP"> <span class='offline' title='OFFLINE'>OFFLINE</span> </span> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div>
