By the time my team was cut due to COVID-19, I was responsible for architecting the infrastructure and code that serves millions of mobile and rich media ads each day. The following are descriptions of just a few of the roles and accomplishments I feel highlight my time there.<\/p>\n<p>Mediaplex was an online advertising company that was started in 1999 and was quite successful during the next couple of years. So successful that in 2001, Mediaplex was acquired by ValueClick. The servers and software that ran the ad serving portion of the business had been setup in 2000 and not had any major updates in almost a decade and their tech stack was showing its age. When Mediaplex first started, ads were simply text with links, perhaps a background image.  But the surge in popularity of \"Rich Media\" ads that began hitting the market in 2009 was beyond what their backend was designed to serve. Competing ad vendors who could serve rich media ads began stealing away valuable business, costing the company revenue and customers. I was hired to lead their Rich Media effort and help modernize their ad serving and metric collection. I architected and deployed a RESTful API for serving rich media ads and built out scalable backend servers and services to handle integration with existing infrastructure.  A large part of Rich Media ad serving and reporting is performed in the client and this required creating a small but powerful cross-browser client-side ad loading framework that worked in tandem with the new backend API. After stablizing the infrastructure, I then managed engineering resources to work with the product services team to ensure the successful deployment of all Rich Media advertising campaigns. The Rich Media enhancements were a great success on all counts, increasing revenue by $1.2 million in the first year alone.<\/p>\n<p>By the time Rich Media ad serving was running smoothly, demand for mobile ads was steadily increasing and I was tasked with implementing a mobile ad solution. I convinced management to have our company join the IAB [<a href='https:\/\/iab.com' target='_blank'>https:\/\/iab.com\/<\/a>], a consortium of online advertising companies that develops industry standards. We participated and were instrumental in defining the updated MRAID 2.0 standard for mobile ad serving which is still currently in use and the defacto standard for mobile ad serving. I wrote the MRAID compliant SDK's for both iOS and Android as well test apps for both platforms to be used internally and by our customers preview ads in a mobile environment before deployment. <\/p>\n","StartMonth":"July","StartYear":"2010 ","EndMonth":" March","EndYear":"2020","StartDate":"July, 2010","EndDate":"March, 2020"},{"Period":"March, 2020 - December, 2020","Company":"D.
