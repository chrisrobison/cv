The majority of their business is derived from schools (student event transportation) and local tours. Mr. Robison developed and implemented software that allowed D Harris to grow from 2 buses to 12 ten years ago. As the current CTO, he updated and enhanced their systems with modern tools to better manage the growing company; real-time bus data, automated maintenance notifications, automated trip confirmations and notifications via email and SMS and more. He developed an algorithm to identify idle times for drivers and match them with jobs, resulting in a nearly doubled daily revenue until the COVID-19 shutdown.</div>
