I am looking forward to collaborating with you to turn your innovative ideas into reality. I have extensive experience in software engineering and leading groups of unruly programmers. Skilled in a wide range of programming languages, including JavaScript, C, C++, Java, Python, Swift, Kotlin and others. I have a proven track record of successfully leading teams, delivering finished product and driving strategic planning, process improvement, and product development initiatives. Recognized for implementing innovative solutions and modernizing systems to support business growth, as evidenced by transforming D. Harris Tours&#x27; operations, resulting in a fleet expansion from 2 to 12 buses. Strong expertise in microservices architecture, Agile methodologies, and cloud services. Committed to continuous learning and staying updated with emerging technologies. A collaborative and proactive problem-solver with a passion for delivering exceptional results. I could go on but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve said too much already &amp;#128513;</p>
