                <p>D Harris Tours is a shuttle bus transportation company which offers 22-44 passenger buses for hire.  The majority of their business is derived from schools (student event transportation) and local tours.  10 years ago, I developed and implemented software that allowed D Harris to grow from 2 buses to 12. But the system I implemented 10 years ago was not made for the increased number of drivers, buses, customers and trips the company had grown to serve.  They were quick to hire me on as their CTO where I updated and enhanced their systems with real-time bus data, automated maintenance notifications, automated trip confirmations and notifications via email and SMS and more. After reviewing the first months trip data, I found that drivers would often sit idle for 4-5 hours, waiting to pickup students they had dropped off at a football game or band practice.  I developed an algorithm to identify these idle times and match them with jobs. I offered drivers an extra hours pay if they did the extra trip.  This nearly doubled the daily revenue until the COVID-19 shutdown.</p>

                </div>
              </header>
                <p>Having worked at the same company for 10 years I wore many hats and performed many roles. By the time my team was cut due to COVID-19, I was responsible for architecting the infrastructure and code that serves millions of mobile and rich media ads each day. The following are descriptions of just a few of the roles and accomplishments I feel highlight my time there.
    Mediaplex was an online advertising company that was started in 1999 and was quite successful during the next couple of years. So successful that in 2001, Mediaplex was acquired by ValueClick. The servers and software that ran the ad serving portion of the business had been setup in 2000 and not had any major updates in almost a decade and their tech stack was showing its age. When Mediaplex first started, ads were simply text with links, perhaps a background image.  But the surge in popularity of &quot;Rich Media&quot; ads that began hitting the market in 2009 was beyond what their backend was designed to serve. Competing ad vendors who could serve rich media ads began stealing away valuable business, costing the company revenue and customers. I was hired to lead their Rich Media effort and help modernize their ad serving and metric collection. I architected and deployed a RESTful API for serving rich media ads and built out scalable backend servers and services to handle integration with existing infrastructure.  A large part of Rich Media ad serving and reporting is performed in the client and this required creating a small but powerful cross-browser client-side ad loading framework that worked in tandem with the new backend API. After stablizing the infrastructure, I then managed engineering resources to work with the product services team to ensure the successful deployment of all Rich Media advertising campaigns. The Rich Media enhancements were a great success on all counts, increasing revenue by $1.2 million in the first year alone.</p>
    <p>By the time Rich Media ad serving was running smoothly, demand for mobile ads was steadily increasing and I was tasked with implementing a mobile ad solution. I convinced management to have our company join the IAB [https://iab.comk], a consortium of online advertising companies that develops industry standards. We participated and were instrumental in defining the updated MRAID 2.0 standard for mobile ad serving which is still currently in use and the defacto standard for mobile ad serving. I wrote the Conversant Mobile Ad MRAID SDK's for both iOS and Android as well test apps for both platforms to be used internally and by our customers to preview ads in a mobile environment before deployment. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
    
                <h5>Highlights</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implemented MRAID SDK&#x27;s on iOS and Android platforms</li>
                    <li>Developed and deployed mobile ad solutions for multiple platforms</li>
                    <li>Designed and deployed &#x27;Rich Media&#x27; ad delivery and reporting framework</li>

                &lt;p&gt;Initially brought in for a 3 month contract to architect and migrate the Mindjet website from PHP to an ASP.Net solution.  My role quickly grew into heading up Mindjet's foray into the Software as a Service (SaaS) arena-- Mindjet Catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mindjet Catalyst is web-based mindmapping software that allows real-time multi-person sharing, collaboration and editing of mindmaps without leaving your browser.  The Catalyst client canvas is written in Flash and written to via Javascript frameworks and API's which handle communication with the server.  The system has been designed such that it is poised to utilize only open standards with HTML5, CSS3, canvas/VML and SVG.  Server-side built with Java/JSP however a large portion of the account handling still resides on the .Net platform requiring the definition and build-out of RESTful services to bridge the two systems.&lt;/p&gt;

My roles and responsibilities were divided between system administration and web development. As the &lt;i&gt;Web Administrator&lt;/i&gt; I was responsible for shared administration of server farm of 30+ machines including Sun servers and Intel PCs, all using Solaris.  I was also responsible for all web-based software, E-commerce, network accessible databases, secure server certificates, web server maintenance, and more. In addition to these administration duties, I was also given a myriad of development projects, including the renovation of the existing system of disassociated and unwieldy collection of flat text db files and dbm's that constituted their 'client database'. I developed an easy to use and coherent system of procedures, tools, scripts, and interfaces built on top of a relational SQL database.
