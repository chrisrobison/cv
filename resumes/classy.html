				<div class= "job">
					<h3>Chief Technology Officer [CTO], D. Harris Tours, Inc.</h3>
					<h4>February 2020 - December 2020</h4>
					<p>D Harris Tours is a shuttle bus transportation company which offers 22-44 passenger buses for hire.  The majority of their business is derived from schools (student event transportation) and local tours.  10 years ago, I developed and implemented software that allowed D Harris to grow from 2 buses to 12. But the system I implemented 10 years ago was not made for the increased number of drivers, buses, customers and trips the company had grown to serve. Hired as CTO where I updated and enhanced their systems with modern tools to better manage the growing company; real-time bus data, automated maintenance notifications, automated trip confirmations and notifications via email and SMS and more. After reviewing the first months trip data, I found that drivers would often sit idle for 4-5 hours, waiting to pickup students they had dropped off at a football game or band practice.  I developed an algorithm to identify these idle times and match them with jobs. I offered drivers an extra hours pay if they did the extra trip.  This nearly doubled the daily revenue until the COVID-19 shutdown.
</p>
					<h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Automated notifications for trips, bus maintenance</li>
						<li>Automated billing and invoicing</li>
						<li>Migrated driver logs to digital format</li>
						<li>Increased daily revenue with better trip optimization</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Manager, Software Engineering, Conversant, Inc. (formerly Mediaplex)</h3>
					<h4>July 2010 - February 2020</h4>
					<p>Working at the same company for 10 years presented many challenges. I wore many hats and performed many roles all while the company changed names and was bought and sold twice. By the time my team was cut due to COVID-19, we were responsible for designing, developing and maintaining the infrastructure and code-base that serves many millions of mobile and rich media ads each day. 

Mediaplex was an online advertising company that was started in 1999 and in 2001 acquired by ValueClick. The servers and software that ran the ad serving platform for the business had been setup in 2000 and had not had any major updates in almost a decade and their tech stack was beginning to show its age. When Mediaplex first started, ads were simply text with links, perhaps a background image.  But the surge in popularity of &quot;Rich Media&quot; ads that began hitting the market in 2009 was beyond what their backend had been engineered to handle. Competing ad vendors who could serve these new rich media ads began stealing away valuable business, costing the company revenue and customers. I was hired to lead their Rich Media effort and help modernize their ad serving and metric collection.

I architected and deployed a RESTful API for serving rich media ads and built out scalable backend servers and services to handle integration with existing infrastructure.  A large part of Rich Media ad serving and reporting is performed in the client and this required creating a small, reliable, cross-browser client-side ad loading framework that worked in tandem with the new backend API. After stablizing the infrastructure, I then managed engineering resources to work with the product services team to ensure the successful deployment of all Rich Media advertising campaigns. The Rich Media enhancements were a great success on all counts, increasing revenue by $1.2 million in the first year alone.

By the time Rich Media ad serving was running smoothly, demand for mobile ads was steadily increasing and I was tasked with implementing a mobile ad solution. I convinced management to have our company join the IAB [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iab.com], a consortium of online advertising companies that develops industry standards. We participated and were instrumental in defining the updated MRAID 2.0 standard for mobile ad serving which is still currently in use and the defacto standard for mobile ad serving. I wrote the initial Conversant Mobile Ad MRAID SDK&#39;s for both iOS and Android as well test apps for both platforms to be used internally and by our customers to preview ads in a mobile environment before deployment. The infrastructure and reporting updates that had been completed for rich media ads carried over to mobile quite nicely and minimized the need for further changes to our infrastructure.
</p>
					<h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Contributed to IAB MRAID 2.0 standard</li>
						<li>Implemented MRAID SDK&#39;s on iOS and Android platforms</li>
						<li>Developed and deployed mobile ad solutions for multiple platforms.</li>
						<li>Designed and deployed &#39;Rich Media&#39; ad delivery and reporting infrastructure.</li>
						<li>Architected and deployed RESTful API for ad serving, metrics and reporting.</li>
						<li>Employed 10 years at same company.</li>

					<h3>Web Architect, Mindjet</h3>
					<h4>September 2007 - July 2010</h4>
					<p>Hired to migrate the Mindjet website from PHP to an ASP.Net solution, my role quickly grew into heading up Mindjet&#39;s foray into the Software as a Service (SaaS) arena-- Mindjet Catalyst.

Mindjet Catalyst was a web-based mindmapping software that allowed browser-based real-time multi-person sharing, collaborating and editing of mindmaps.  The Catalyst client canvas was originally written in Flash and my team was responsible for porting the Flash app to a more standards-based implementation utilizing HTML canvas and Javascript.  The new application was designed to utilize open standards with HTML5, CSS3, Javascipt, canvas and SVG with few to zero dependancies on external 3rd party libraries.</p>
